# 🐍 Vipyr Programming Language

**Vipyr** is a custom Python-based programming language with unique syntax enhancements for cleaner, more readable code. It's designed to simplify common patterns, introduce expressive syntax elements, and support modern coding styles.

## ✨ Features

- `++` / `--` operators for increment/decrement
- `unless` keyword as an alternative to `if not`
- `switch` / `case` / `default` for branching logic
- Custom function and class declaration syntax
- Easy-to-read import statements (e.g., `get random`)
- Natural string interpolation
- `len(x)` becomes `x.length`
- `equals` instead of `=`, `same as` instead of `==`
- Keyword operators: `add`, `sub`, `multiply`
- Range loops with `up to`

## 📦 Getting Started

### Compile Vipyr Code

Use the `init.exe` executable by dragging the `.vp` file to convert `.vp` files into Python.

# 🧪 Example Code
```bash
get random

function greet(name as string) {
  log "Hello, ${name}!"
}

number equals 5
unless number same as 10 {
  number++
}
```
